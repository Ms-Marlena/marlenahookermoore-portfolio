## Description
I built this project to make an easy way to create a professional README for my projects. 
I learned a lot about creating prompts, and about writing to files.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Installation
Install the dependencies with `npm i`

## Usage
Start the project with `node index.js` in the terminal, then answer the questions. 

See the walkthrough video link above.

## Next Steps

I plan to include the actual licenses in an update.
