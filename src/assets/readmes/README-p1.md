# Password Generator
Bootcamp Project #3
website link:
github link:
## Description
This project solves the problem of creating a unique and random password with whatever criteria is required. It's difficult to think of unique passwords, and every app requires a strong password now.
I learned more about for loops, how to create an array that has several different types of input based on what the user selects, and more about how to insert information into html from the javascript file. 

## Installation
Go to the website in a regular browser.

## Usage
Click the "Generate Password" button, answer the prompts, and see your new password!
