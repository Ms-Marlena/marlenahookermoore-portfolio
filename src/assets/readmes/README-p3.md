## Description
 This program solves the problem of being a small company with a small budget needing to generate a unique logo with the company initials as its text, and colors of its own choosing.
In making this project, I learned about creating models and classes that inherit properties from the model. I also learned about SVG files, and how to change coordinates to ensure the best placement and size of text, along with the coordinates to create the shapes of triangle, square, and circle.

## Installation
To install this project, install the dependencies with 'npm i', then run the program by typing 'node index.js', all in the terminal. 

## Usage
Follow the prompts to answer the questions about specific shape, text, shape color, and text color. Find your logo in the ___ file, under the name of the shape selected (ex: Circle.svg'). If there is another file with that name already, it will be overwritten, so be sure to copy and save your logo in a different folder if you want to save it.
